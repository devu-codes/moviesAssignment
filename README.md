# Team Project Planner Tool 

### Overview
## ** Please refer to master branch for code. 
This project is an implementation of a team project planner tool that consists of API's for managing users, teams, and a team board with tasks.

The goal of the project is to implement the API methods defined in the base abstract classes. The directory consists of these base abstract classes, and the project involves creating a module for the concrete implementation of these base classes, extending them.

The input and output for each API is in the form of JSON strings, with the structure defined in the method doc string. Each API adhere to the constraints and raise exceptions for invalid inputs. The method doc will include some additional requirements specific to the method.
